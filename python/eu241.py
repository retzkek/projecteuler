solution by Kevin Retzke (retzkek@gmail.com), April 2009

For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.

Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer as  p(n)    =   σ(n) / n
Find the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^(18) for which p(n) has the form k + 1⁄2, where k is an integer.
"""

# thoughts:
# p(n) must reduce to some fraction with 2 as the denominator,
